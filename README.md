just go to my server.js and read the code where in which i have imported different modules.
now come to main part 
 where we do createServer((req, res)=>{
   when i say path.join(__dirname,) // yaha pr usually project ki directory ka path stored already hota hai
   // humare specification keh hisab yeh bus new files and folder ko merge krne kaa kaam krta hai...
   now come to the thing where in which i created a contentType where i created a map in which i show what are the file type my server can accept.
   other thing i can show u is when there is nothing i mean no file is rendering on the server tab 'application/octet-string' likhte hai hum which says ki jus server binary file on the server.
   // other part is just to easy to read it from chatgpt.
})
